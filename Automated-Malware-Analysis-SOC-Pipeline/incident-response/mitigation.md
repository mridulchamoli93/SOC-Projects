# ✅ Incident Mitigation & Containment Steps

## 1. Initial Detection
Suspicious command executions were detected through auditd telemetry at 11:07 AM, including:
- chmod
- rm -rf
- ln -sfn
- snapctl execution

These mapped directly to **MITRE T1059 (Command Execution)**.

---

## 2. Host Isolation
The affected Ubuntu host was immediately isolated from:
- External network access
- Internal lab bridging

This prevented any potential lateral movement or C2 communication.

---

## 3. Malicious Process Termination
All suspicious processes were manually reviewed and terminated:
```bash
ps aux | grep firefox
ps aux | grep snap
kill -9 <pid>
4. Persistence Removal
The following modified locations were cleaned:

bash
Copy code
rm -rf /home/kali/snap/firefox/4848/.config
rm -rf /home/kali/.config/ibus/bus
5. Integrity Restoration
Permissions reset:

bash
Copy code
chmod 755 /home/kali/.config
All symbolic links created during the attack were removed.

6. Forensic Preservation
Evidence preserved:

auditd logs

exec_monitor logs

timestamps

IOC list

7. Hardening Measures Applied
auditd rules hardened

Unauthorized snap privilege monitoring enabled

YARA static scanning enforced before execution
